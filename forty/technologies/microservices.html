								<h1>Introduction</h1>
							</header>
							<p>
								WOZiTech promotes the use of Microservices to break down complex applications into
								easily maintained, deployed and managed components, with use of best breed technologies for each
								service (or in the case of WOZiTech projects, demonstration of new technologies by a given service)
								with scale and security built-in.
							</p>
							<p>
								Microservices is an IT buzzword, but what are microservices? Let&apos;s demistify them here.
							</p>
						</div>
					</section>
		
				<section id="isolation">
					<div class="inner">
						<header class="major">
							<h2>Isolation</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>Runtime</h3>
						<p>
							First, and foremost, microservices are isolated from each other at runtime. A failure in one service
							does not impact on another service. This applies not just across different services but equally each
							instance of the same service. This latter isolation is where &quot;serverless functions&quot; come
							into their own. To isolate each instance of a service, if a system-level error occurs in a service instance then
							that service instance should be rejected and a new instance of that service started to backfill.
						</p>
						<h3>Deployment</h3>
						<p>
							Second, microservices are isolated from each other during deployment. A failure in one service deployment
							does not impact upon other services, during or after the deployment. More than just each service can be deployed
							independently, each service can be deployed to different targets/platforms.
						</p>
						<h3>Packaging</h3>
						<p>
							Third, microservices are isolated from each other through packaging. A change in one service does not impact
							upon other services. A change in one service which consequently requries deployment, does not require the
							re-deployment of other services.
							<br/><br/>
							Isolated packaging ensures the smallest scope of deployment and consequently, the smallest scope of change. Low
							level of changes encourages high levels of availability.
						</p>
						<p>
							Consider also service maturity; where the microservice is extended over time.

							Versioning of APIs are common practice; a typical node application uses npm
							to manage 3rd part libraries, all at specific versions within package.json. Every microservice should be
							versioned and every client should define the version of API to which they are subscribing to, even if that
							client declaration is "latest" (version).
							<br/><br/>
							A stable service is one that stable clients will depend upon. If having to make changes to a stable service
							consider first creating and deploying a new service with those chamges, thus isolating the existing stable service.
							Over time as this new service establises itself and itself becomes stable, consider then whether to
							merge it back to the original service (as a new verion of).
						</p>
						<h3>Data</h3>
						<p>
							And finally, it is well accepted that microservices should own their data in its entirety. Each microservice
							should have its own data store; that data store chosen specifically for the type of data it owns (or abstracts
							in the case of integrating services).
							<br/><br/>
							A caching microservice would benefit from fast storage, such as, redis/memcached. An analytics service would
							benefit from a warehouse style store.
							<br/><br/>
							By having its own store of data and owning that store, each microservice is able to apply its own optimisations
							for accessing that, safe that it does not impact other services.
						</p>
						<p>
							But there is a playoff on how much isolation can be supported and this vary across projects and services.

					<div class="inner">
						<header class="major">
							<h2>Security Built-In</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Not specific to microservices per se, but a mandatory characteristic as seen by WOZiTech, is that all
							microservices should enforce security for all their APIs; even if that security is simply to "allow all".
						</p>
						<p>
							There are many different approches to authentication (identity) and authorisation (approval); we shall shorten this to simply <i>A&amp;A</i>.
							The fact that microservices are stateless implies A&amp;A must be performed on every call. For performance and isolation,
							it is not ideal for any microservices to have to rely on an exteral lookup for A&amp;A resolution.
						</p>
						<p>
							Token based A&amp;A is the recommended approach as the token assures identity (authentication) and contains all
							information necessary for approval (authorisation).

							<h2>Microservices are not</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Sumamry on what microservices are not. Unlike SOA, they are fine grained and do not set about to encourage reuse; they have no specific contract.
							No dependencies between services and no &quot;managed&quot; orchestration between services. No platform specific.</p>
						<p>
							What do we mean by &quot;unmanaged orchestration&quot;
						</p>
						<p>
							What do we mean by &quot;not platform specific&quot;?
						</p>
						<p>
							What do we mean by &quot;not encouraging reuse&quot;?
						</p>
						<p>
							What do we mean by &quot;no specific contract&quot;?
						</p>
						<p>
							What do we mean by &quot;fine grained&quot;? Microservices are constructed at function level whereas SOA is component level.
							A component will have many functions composed from many actions, whereas a function has a single action.
							<br/><br/>
						</p>
						<p>
							Through less focus on contract, reuse and with a focus on function not component, less effort is spent designing microservices.
							This makes microservices more suited to an agile development lifecycle, than that imposed by a Service Oriented Architecture.
